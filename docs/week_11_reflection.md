‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

Key Takeaways: 
What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
    I learned that we will essentially put everything we have worked on into a comprehensive project. The expectation is for us to not only make the working app, but let our creativity come out. We will rely on things we have learned in class and will be expected to think of solutions if we get stuck on a problem. Problem solving.```
     

Concept Connections: Which Week 1‚Äì10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice
    My stongest: I feel tat the Tkinter and Sqlite have been the topics that I have been able to comprehend more efficiently
    Need work on: getting syntax more easily flowing when writting code. I have to rely so much on documentation right now, that it can be at times frustrating.

Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
    Folder set up becasue we got a few different examples of how to set it up and was a little condused on what, besides the list we got, is required. I ended up adding my gui_tkinter_window file where I put the code for the gui in there.

Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?
    With my schedule, office hours on Sundays seem to work the best. I work and live on the west coast so most of the other hours are either when I am at work or after-class when I am driving home from work.

üß† Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale
List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.

#	Feature Name	Difficulty (1‚Äì3)	Why You Chose It / Learning Goal
1	```History Tracker``` -  I feel that any good weather app will have temp trackers to be able to show the user patters

2	```Simple Stats```- Simalary, stats are important for users to be able to see what the day's highest or lowest temp was.

3	```Theme Switcher```- I use this alot myself. I like being able to switch to dark mode. I will probably start on dark mode but have an option for user to go to light mode.
Enhancement: I will add descriptive images for the different temps.

üóÇÔ∏è ```Section 3```: High-Level Architecture Sketch
Add a diagram or a brief outline that shows:
PLEASE SEE SCREENSHOTS FOLDER
Core modules and folders

üìä ```Section 4```: Data Model Plan
Fill in your planned data files or tables:

File/Table Name	Format (txt, json, csv, other)	Example Row
weather_history.txt	

```txt```	2025-06-09,Oxnard,78,Sunny,precipitation

üìÜ Section 5: Personal Project Timeline (Weeks 12‚Äì17)
Customize based on your availability:

Week	Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Key Milestone
12	API setup	Error handling	Tkinter shell	Buffer day	Basic working app
13	Feature 1			Integrate	Feature 1 complete. Any week 12 still missing
14	Feature 2 start		Review & test	Finish	Feature 2 complete
15	Feature 3	Polish UI	Error passing	Refactor	All features complete
16	Enhancement	Docs	Tests	Packaging	Ready-to-ship app
17	Rehearse	Buffer	Showcase	‚Äì	Demo Day

‚ö†Ô∏è Section 6: Risk Assessment
Identify at least 3 potential risks and how you‚Äôll handle them.
1. User inputs - I will use try and except to make sure inputs are valid
2. API Key fails - will add a back-up API Key
3. missing weather data- will clean up data when called.




ü§ù Section 7: Support Requests
What specific help will you ask for in office hours or on Slack?

I will be in office hours weekly. Help in debuggin as that is what i have spent a majority of my time doing.
