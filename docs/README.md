# Capstone Assignment - Weather Dashboard
```Welcome to my first real app! This app is designed to allow user to retrieve not only current weather data, but also track historical weather patterns. Want to know what the last 7 days have looked like? HOw about in the last month? This wasy to use interface simplifies searches.```


## Overview
```I have built out a GUI using examples and learning methods from class and assignments.```

## Learninig Objectives

## Assignmet Tasks

``` Feature 1```
SIMPLE STATS

  My first feature is getting current data from a city of your choosing. This request will give us the current temperature, wind speed, conditions, the max temperature of that day, how much rain and/or snow.

``` Feature 2```
LIGHT/DARK THEME SWITCHER

  I chose light/dark theme switcher because I use this often in my own personal use. I feel that being able to switch colors adds a little personalization

``` Feature 3```  HISTORY TRACKER

  I wanted to show patterns of weather data from the last month. I used matplotlib to display the line-graph that can display data from 7 days, 14 days, or 30 days.
