    Need work on:


Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
    Folder set up becasue we got a few different examples of how to set it up and was a little condused on what, besides the list we got, is required. I ended up adding my gui_tkinter_window file where I put the code for the gui in there.

Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?
    With my schedule, office hours on Sundays seem to work the best. I work and live on the west coast so most of the other hours are either when I am at work or after-class when I am driving home from work.
